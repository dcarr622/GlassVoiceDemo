GlassVoiceDemo
==============

A simple [GDK](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/) app for Glass that uses the [GAST](https://github.com/gast-lib/gast-lib) library to transcribe speech to text on Glass.

From the development process for [Glass Genius](http://www.glassjournalism.io/2014/12/09/trying-glass-genius/).
